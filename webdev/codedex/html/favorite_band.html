        Nightwish is a Finnish symphonic metal band formed in 1996 by keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen.<br> 
        Known for their powerful blend of metal and orchestral music, Nightwish has become one of the most successful bands in their genre.<br> 
        They are celebrated for their dynamic compositions, intricate musical arrangements, and the distinct, operatic vocals of their singers,<br>
        including current vocalist Floor Jansen. 
        Nightwish's music often explores themes of fantasy, mythology, and nature, with notable albums like <em>Once</em>, <em>Dark Passion Play</em>,<br>
        and <em>Endless Forms Most Beautiful</em> showcasing their evolving sound and artistic vision.
